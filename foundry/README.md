# Protein design with Foundry

Foundry provides tooling and infrastructure for using and training all classes of models for protein design, including design (RFD3), inverse folding (ProteinMPNN) and protein folding (RF3).

All models within Foundry rely on [AtomWorks](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/atomworks) - a unified framework for manipulating and processing biomolecular structures - for both training and inference.

## Getting Started
### Quickstart guide
**Installation**
```bash
pip install "rc-foundry[all]"
```

**Intel XPU Installation**

For Intel XPU devices, install PyTorch with XPU support first, then install Foundry.
```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu
pip install "rc-foundry[all]"
```
> [!NOTE]
> Use `pip` (not `uv`) for XPU installs since UV re-resolves dependencies and may replace your XPU torch with the standard PyPI version.

**macOS (Apple Silicon) Installation**

MPS support is available via a community fork. Install PyTorch first, then install directly from the fork:
```bash
pip install torch
pip install "rc-foundry[all] @ git+https://github.com/fnachon/foundry.git"
```

All three models — **RFD3**, **RF3**, and **ProteinMPNN/LigandMPNN** — run on Apple Silicon MPS.

> [!NOTE]
> - The `rf3` extra (cuEquivariance) is Linux-only and is automatically skipped on macOS.
> - Use `float32` precision — `bfloat16` is not supported on MPS. The MPS accelerator is selected and float32 precision is enforced automatically.
> - Inference only; multi-GPU training is not supported on MPS.
> - For `rf3 fold`, pass an absolute path to the input CIF file.

**Downloading weights** Models can be downloaded to a target folder with:
```
foundry install base-models --checkpoint-dir <path/to/ckpt/dir>
```
where `checkpoint-dir` will be `~/.foundry/checkpoints` by default. Foundry always searches `~/.foundry/checkpoints` plus any colon-separated entries in `$FOUNDRY_CHECKPOINT_DIRS` during inference or subsequent commands to find checkpoints. `base-models` installs the latest RFD3, RF3 and MPNN variants - you can also download all of the models supported (including multiple checkpoints of RF3) with `all`, or by listing the models sequentially (e.g. `foundry install rfd3 rf3 ...`).
To list the registry of available checkpoints:
```
foundry list-available
```
To check what you already have downloaded (searches `~/.foundry/checkpoints` plus `$FOUNDRY_CHECKPOINT_DIRS` if set):
```
foundry list-installed
```

>*See `examples/all.ipynb` for how to run each model and design proteins end-to-end in a notebook.*

### Docker Image

There is an official [Foundry image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rosettacommons/foundry) maintained by the [Rosetta Commons](https://rosettacommons.org/). The default image comes with the model weights for the available models, but you can use the `slim` tag to either use pre-exiting model weights or use the image to download the available model weights. 

For more information and example syntax, see the [Overview on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rosettacommons/foundry).

The recipe to create the Docker image can be found in `foundry/examples/docker` and can be used as a "blue-print" for creating your own images. 

### Google Colab
For an interactive Google Colab notebook walking through a basic design pipeline with RFD3, MPNN, and RF3, please see the [IPD Design Pipeline Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZwIMV3n9h0ZOnIXX0GyKUuoiahgifBxh?usp=sharing).

### RFdiffusion3 (RFD3)

[RFdiffusion3](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.18.676967v2) is an all-atom generative model capable of designing protein structures under complex constraints.

> *See [models/rfd3/README.md](models/rfd3/README.md) for complete documentation.*

### RFdiffusion3NA (RFD3NA)

[RFdiffusion3NA](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.18.676967v3) is an extension of RFDiffusion3 capable of designing also nucleic acid structures under complex constraints.

### RosettaFold3 (RF3)

[RF3](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.14.670328) is a structure prediction neural network that narrows the gap between closed-source AF-3 and open-source alternatives.

### ProteinMPNN
[ProteinMPNN](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add2187) and [LigandMPNN](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02626-1) are lightweight inverse-folding models which can be use to design diverse sequences for backbones under constrained conditions.

## Development

### Code Organization

**Strict dependency flow:** `foundry` → `atomworks`

- **atomworks**: Structure I/O, preprocessing, featurization
- **foundry**: Model architectures, training, inference endpoints
- **models/\<model\>:** Released models.

#### For Core Developers (Multiple Packages)

Install both `foundry` and models in editable mode for development:

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[all,dev]'
```

This approach allows you to:
- Modify `foundry` shared utilities and see changes immediately
- Work on specific models without installing all models
- Add new models as independent packages in `models/`

> [!NOTE]
> Running tests is not currently supported, test files may be missing.

### Adding New Models

To add a new model:

1. Create `models/<model_name>/` directory with its own `pyproject.toml`
2. Add `foundry` as a dependency
3. Implement model-specific code in `models/<model_name>/src/`
4. Users can install with: `uv pip install -e ./models/<model_name>`

### Pre-commit Formatting

We ship a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that runs `make format` (via `ruff format`) before each commit. Enable it once per clone:

```bash
pip install pre-commit  # if not already installed
pre-commit install
```

After installation the hook automatically formats the repo whenever you `git commit`. Use `pre-commit run --all-files` to apply it manually.
